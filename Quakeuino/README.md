# ForSocietyProject - Quakeuino module


Code for the earthquake sensor placed on the buildings that are at risk of collapsing after an earthquake.

## Description


This part of the project makes use of the Arduino and ESP8266 boards, gyroscope and accelerometer module to collect data about buildings during an earthquake and notify the intervention teams and authorities about the damaged or even collapsed buildings.
By turning on the blue LED, we know that the sensor caught the free fall state which means that the roof is fallen down.
